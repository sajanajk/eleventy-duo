The EU says it will launch proceedings to remove parliamentary immunity from two MEPs implicated in an ongoing corruption scandal.

Parliamentary President Roberta Metsola said she had taken the move after a request from Belgian police.

But her statement did not name the MEPs involved.

The scandal erupted last month after one MEP and three others were arrested on charges of corruption and money-laundering.

While authorities have not named the country behind the bribery network, numerous EU sources have accused Qatar of running the operation.
